# NLP and Text_Mining


In this notebook I will be adressing NLP and text mining tasks, starting off with the basics and then moving on to implementing some ideas from NLP articles into working codes. then some higher level concepts like Transformers,BERT and attention etc...

## first project : Scientific Articles' abstract text mining 

- This project is comprised of 3 parts:
1. Textuel Analysis 
2. EDA ( Exploratory Data Analysis )
3. Clustering



## Second project : Dimensionality Reduction and clustering + interprability.

- This project is comprised of 3 parts:
1. Clustering on orignal data (Classic 4 data which comprises of scientific articles' abstracts , and BBC data which contains headlines from the bbc news channel )
2. + This is done on the data without any dimensionality reduction technique 
3. EDA ( Exploratory Data Analysis )
4. Clustering
