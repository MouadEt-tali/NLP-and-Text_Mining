            "A fast simultaneous input vector generation and gate replacement algorithm for leakage power reduction. ['Lei Cheng', 'Liang Deng', 'Deming Chen', 'Martin D. F. Wong'] 2006 DAC 131752 ['132550', '530568', '436486', '134259', '283007', '134422', '282140', '1134324'] Input vector control (IVC) technique is based on the observation that the leakage current in a CMOS logic gate depends on the gate input state and a good input vector is able to minimize the leakage when the circuit is in the sleep mode. The gate replacement technique is a very effective method to further reduce the leakage current. In this paper we propose a fast algorithm to find a low leakage input vector with simultaneous gate replacement. Results on MCNC91 benchmark circuits show that our algorithm produces $14 %$ better leakage current reduction with several orders of magnitude speedup in runtime for large circuits compared to the previous state-of-the-art algorithm. In particular the average runtime for the ten largest combinational circuits has been dramatically reduced from 1879 seconds to 0.34 seconds.\n",

['Lerong Cheng', 'Phoebe Wong', 'Fei Li', 'Yan Lin', 'Lei He'] 2005 DAC 131759 ['214244', '215701', '214503', '282575', '214411', '214505', '132929'] Device optimization considering supply voltage Vdd and threshold voltage Vt tuning does not increase chip area but has a great impact on power and performance in the nanometer technology. This paper studies the simultaneous evaluation of device and architecture optimization for FPGA. We first develop an efficient yet accurate timing and power evaluation method called trace-based model. By collecting trace information from cycle-accurate simulation of placed and routed FPGA benchmark circuits and re-using the trace for different Vdd and Vt we enable the device and architecture co-optimization for hundreds of combinations. Compared to the baseline FPGA which has the architecture same as the commercial FPGA used by Xilinx and has Vdd suggested by ITRS but Vt optimized by our device optimization architecture and device co-optimization can reduce energy-delay product by 20.5% without any chip area increase compared to the conventional FPGA architecture. Furthermore considering power-gating of unused logic blocks and interconnect switches our co-optimization method reduces energy-delay product by 54.7% and chip area by 8.3%. To the best of our knowledge this is the first in-depth study on architecture and device co-optimization for FPGAs.\n"
